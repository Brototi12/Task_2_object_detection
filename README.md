#**Overview**

# This tutorial walks through the following steps:

1.Gathering and labeling a dataset

2.Exporting the dataset for YOLOv5 training

3.Training YOLOv5 to recognize custom objects

4.Evaluating the trained model's performance

5.Running inference on test images

#**Dataset Preparation**

You will need a labeled dataset to train the YOLOv5 model. The dataset should be in YOLO format, and it can be created using tools like Roboflow or manually annotated using LabelImg.

#**Training YOLOv5**

The notebook provides the necessary scripts to:

*Clone the YOLOv5 repository

*Install dependencies

*Configure training parameters (e.g., batch size, epochs, model architecture)

*Start the training process

#**Evaluation**

Once training is complete, the notebook includes steps to analyze the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).

#**Inference**

You can run inference on test images to visualize the model's object detection capabilities.

#**Requirements**

Make sure you have the following installed:

*Python 3.x

*PyTorch

*OpenCV

*Roboflow (for dataset handling)

*Jupyter Notebook

#**Usage**

1.Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

2.Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook PDS_12_TASK_2.ipynb

4.Follow the steps in the notebook to train and test your YOLOv5 model.
